            <br>
            <p>MHAC and SHRC will be collaborating to raise awareness for suicide prevention. The event will be held at the ECG picnic tables on September 9, at 3pm. At the event, students can write encouraging messages to show support for our fellow members of the ECG community, further inclusifying our environment.</p>

            <h3>MHAC coding projects now available</h3>
            <p><em>Last edited 9/6/2022</em></p>
            <p>MHAC's committment to improving the mental health of the ECG community has encouraged members to follow their passions and creativity to develop unique projects. Through the CTIS courses offered at Guilford College, Ajay Dakoriya had the opportunity to design wellness-oriented computer programs in the Java language. His first program was an Android application called Brighter Days -- a game that teaches younger students about the importance of mental health. He next designed an application called Mindle -- a unique take on the popular game Wordle that aims to raise awareness for wellness with a word pool consists of terms all relevant to mental health.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To download Ajay's programs, please visit this <a class="outsidelink" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h1hrK0aigDFm9dZupTn5UHpftQjY2ooA?usp=sharing">Google Drive folder</a>.</p>
