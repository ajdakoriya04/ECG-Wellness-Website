            <h2>School Groups</h2>
            <p>The ECG community offers several student-run school groups with a focus on student wellness.</p> 
            <h3>MHAC</h3>
            <p>Recently established in 2020, ECG's <strong>Mental Health Advocacy Club (MHAC)</strong> aims to create an inclusive school environment where everyone -- both students and staff -- has love and support from each other without stigma of mental illness. The club has found quick success, raising nearly $1,000 for charity in its first two years of activity, and hosting several popular events, such as the Brain Break, Candy Grams, and Easter Egg Hunt. Though officially designated a service club, MHAC events are diverse in the skills and interests they may involve. Whether you're into STEM, humanities, or the arts, you can support mental health while doing what you love. More info on MHAC activities can be found on the News page.</p>
            <p>Please contact <strong id=MHACemail>mentalhealthclub.ecg@gmail.com</strong> if you would like to join the club or have any questions.</p>
            <h3>NHS</h3>
            <p>The Phoenix Chapter of the <strong>National Honor Society (NHS)</strong> at ECG hosts multiple initiatives that allow students to offer guidance to each other. Phoenix Buddies, for example, is a program that pairs members with underclassmen students, helping to support their transition to ECG. NHS also offers tutoring for underclassmen classes, as well as various workshops on work management and writing résumés.</p>
            <p>Please contact Mr. Johnson or NHS leadership for more information.</p>
            <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
            <p>There are several community organizations in the Triad area that have several mental health services, as well as opportunities to volunteer, namely Mental Health Greensboro (MHAG) and the Guilford chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Both groups have collaborated with ECG on a recurring basis through MHAC activities.
